    "multiTenancy": "Uses Shared Database + Shared Schema approach for cost efficiency and simplicity. Row-level isolation achieved through automatic tenant_id filtering at application layer.",
    "scalability": "Optimized for 100s of tenants. For 1000s of tenants, consider implementing schema-per-tenant approach with connection pooling.",
    "security": "Production deployment requires: HTTPS/TLS, stronger JWT secret, environment-specific configurations, rate limiting, and database backups.",
    "performance": "Includes database indexes on frequently queried columns (tenant_id, status, user_id). Consider implementing caching for read-heavy operations.",
    "extensibility": "Architecture supports adding features like: real-time notifications, advanced reporting, API rate limiting, two-factor authentication, and SSO integration."
